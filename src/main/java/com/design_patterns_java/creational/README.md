In this implementation:

The class has a private static variable instance to hold the single instance of the class.
The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
The getInstance() method is public and static, responsible for providing access to the single instance of the class.
The getInstance() method uses double-checked locking to ensure thread safety and lazy initialization. This means that the instance is only created when it's requested for the first time, and subsequent calls return the same instance.
The doSomething() method is an example method within the Singleton class, just to demonstrate its functionality.
This implementation ensures that only one instance of the Singleton class is created, and it's thread-safe, efficient, and lazy-loaded. Additionally, it prevents instantiation via reflection by throwing an exception if the constructor is called from within the class.
